# Heart-Disease-Predictor
This is a heart disease prediction classification model with an accuracy of 88%

This project was a part of the course [Complete A.I. & Machine Learning, Data Science Bootcamp by ZTM](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-zero-to-mastery/?couponCode=CP130525) by [Andrei Neagoie](https://github.com/aneagoie) and [mrdbourke](https://github.com/mrdbourke).

I modified and extended the project through experimentation, ie, trying different models and different hyperparameters, and then building and deploying a web app using Gradio and providing access to anyone using GitHub and Hugging Face
